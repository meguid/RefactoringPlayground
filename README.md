# Refactoring Playground
Me, [Moaz](https://twitter.com/moazhussam), and [Mostafa](https://twitter.com/mostafakram) was having some fun at [SwiftCairo](https://twitter.com/SwiftCairo)'s coffee meetup doing some refactoring to [this repo](https://github.com/soapyigu/Swift-30-Projects/tree/master/Project%2004%20-%20Todo) to make the code more testable. #WIP
